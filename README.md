# Brody World Physique Obsidia

**Status:** FOUNDATION / DOC-FIRST / NO RUNTIME YET  
**Authority:** Obsidia / X108 remains external and unchanged.  
**Purpose:** build the physical-world, visual, temporal and action-consequence learning layer used by Brody without turning Brody into a monolithic model.

## Core idea

The project is not trying to make a model memorize the world.

It builds a system that can:

1. observe a state;
2. situate it in space and time;
3. represent objects, relations, provenance and uncertainty;
4. observe or propose an action/transformation;
5. predict the next state;
6. compare prediction with reality;
7. store the validated experience;
8. improve routing, skills and expectations;
9. modify model weights only when accumulated evidence justifies it.

## Doctrine

- **Skill before encyclopedic knowledge.**
- **State -> action -> consequence before verbal definition.**
- Space, time, identity, relation, transformation, provenance and uncertainty are first-class.
- Perception is evidence, not truth.
- External AI models are replaceable organs, not canonical cognition.
- Native Memory provides context and validated experience; it does not become decision authority.
- Learning may first modify routing, skills, replay strategy and expectations.
- Parametric learning (LoRA/fine-tuning/distillation) is a later, evidence-driven step.
- Brody proposes/composes; **KX108_ONLY** remains the decision authority.
- No external model may bypass Obsidia contracts or mutate the kernel.
- No Graphiti/Neo4j runtime is reintroduced here.
- Trading is out of scope.

## Relation to existing Obsidia layers

This repository does **not** replace:

- OS Trad / IR
- SENS / Cognition
- MMonde
- Native Memory
- Brody
- Reverse OS
- X108 / GuardX108 / KX108
- receipts / replay

It prepares a reusable physical/visual/world layer that can later feed:

- Brody visual cognition and generation;
- GPS / Defense / Aviation;
- Jarvis / Jarjar perception;
- Monde / Pokémon visualization;
- future robotics or embodied agents.

## Current milestone

**F0 — Documentation + contract audit.**

No model download, runtime installation or weight integration should happen before F0 verifies how the proposed contracts map onto current SENS, MMonde, Native Memory, OS Trad/IR and GPS evidence structures.
